                            <p>No.</p>

                                <strong>Can the students in a computer science class work on different parts of a
                     larger IT development? For example, where a number of students are working on
                     different sections of a school website or database.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes, but the students must be working on independent and non-communicating parts
                  of a larger development. For example, it is acceptable for two students to develop
                  unrelated utilities in an open source project, but not for two students to develop
                  different web pages as part of a single website. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>How much assistance and guidance should I give the students?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>It is important that the solution is the student’s own work, although a first
                  draft may be submitted and informal discussions between the teacher and student
                  can occur. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Is it necessary for the students to have all the skills required for the
                     development of a solution, especially the product, before they
                  start?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>No. The student may have a basic understanding of the software and project
                  management techniques required to complete the solution at the start. However, he
                  or she will acquire additional skills during the duration of this activity. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What if the student does not know the software they need or want to
                     use?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>The student will either need to learn to use the software or adjust his or her
                  proposed product. This is also the reason why criteria A and B should be approved
                  before the student begins to develop the product.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Can the same student reuse an extended essay title and a topic for the
                     solution?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>No, this is not allowed, and in any case the extended essay is significantly
                  different from the solution.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>The solution is the complete internally assessed work of the student and consists
                  of three components:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="liWithoutP">

                                <li class="liWithoutP">
                                    <strong>the product</strong>, the software solution developed by the student
                     for the client </li>
                                <li class="liWithoutP">
                                    <strong>documentation</strong>, the supporting documents, including a video of
                     the product functioning, linked to the development of the product. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What preparatory work is needed with the zip file?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Teachers should download the zip file into a shared area on the school network and
                  unzip it. </p>
                            <p>It is advisable to test the zip file by opening up the documentation files (either
                  as .rtf or .odt) and then saving them as .pdf. The links are designed so that if
                  the file name is not changed, they will function with .pdf extensions (with the
                  exception of the video, which has a default extension of .avi). </p>
                            <p>The zip file can be used for Microsoft or OpenOffice files. The student should
                  delete the files that are not required.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What is a product?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>This refers to the software solution (for example, website, database, programming
                  construct) created following the design cycle, which addresses the problem the
                  student has identified. The product is a single item created using one or more
                  applications that can be tested by the moderator.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Can the student make several products to satisfy the requirements for the
                     solution?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>No. Only one product must be submitted, although students may integrate more than
                  one software type within it. Examples include a website that uses underlying data
                  from a database or a website using applets developed in Java.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Does the product have to address a real problem?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes. The product must be real, current and able to be implemented.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Do ideas for the product have to be related to the school?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>No. Furthermore, clients and/or advisers can come from businesses or other sources
                  outside of the school environment.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>When choosing an idea for a product, is it sufficient that it only
                     benefits the client?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Can the student justify just one possible product?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What do you mean by the term adviser?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>The term adviser is used to describe the third party used by the student to assist
                  him or her in the development of the product. An adviser must be used if the
                  student is the client. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Does the student have to present evidence of consultation with the client
                     and/or adviser?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes. The student will self-penalize in criterion A if no evidence is presented.
                  However, it is not necessary to provide additional documentation providing the
                  consultation is explicitly referred to in the text. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>When is the best time to start working on the internal
                     assessment?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>There is no date prescribed, but it is recommended that students should have the
                  necessary software, file and folder management skills to complete the internal
                  assessment successfully. It is also advisable that the solution is completed up to
                  criterion B by the end of the first year of study to allow the product to be
                  completed independently in consultation with the client and/or adviser. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>How much class time should be allowed for work on the
                  solution?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>The <em>Computer science guide</em> suggests <strong>30 class hours</strong>.
                  Class time is necessary to provide adequate opportunity for the teacher to monitor
                  a student’s progress and to ensure that all of the work is the student’s own. It
                  is expected that students will spend time outside of class to complete the
                  internal assessment. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Are programming skills required for the development of the
                     product?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>It depends on the type of product proposed. In OOP-related topics the answer is
                  yes, but in other types of solution programming skills may not be required,
                  although this may limit the appropriateness of the product.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What do you mean by a trivial product?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>This refers to a product that could be created by somebody who has never attended
                  a computer science class. Typical examples of trivial products include single page
                  websites, flat-file databases, programming solutions consisting entirely of copied
                  code.</p>
                            <p>Trivial products will result in the student losing marks in criterion C where the
                  maximum mark for this type of product is likely to be 4. The student may also lose

                                <li class="liWithoutP">Criterion B—because the designs will have significant omissions, for example,
                     overall structure will be simplistic, there is likely to be a limited range of
                     resources and techniques, and the test plan may also be limited or
                     non-existent. </li>
                                <li class="liWithoutP">Criterion D—as it may not be possible to determine the functionality and
                     extensibility.</li>

                            <p>Other marks might be lost in other criteria and these will be evident at

                                <strong>Can a student use templates and wizards?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>No, if the product is based on a template or wizard that completely determines its
                  structure and layout; then there is no original input from the student. For
                  example, this may be copying a web-based template, an exemplar database provided
                  with the software or significant blocks of code from an internet site.</p>
                            <p>However, if the student uses the template or wizard as a starting point in
                  developing the product that is unrecognizable from it—that is, making substantial
                  and appropriate changes—this may be permissible. For example, a student may use a
                  website template, but has control over the structure and layout. In this
                  situation, it is expected that appropriate techniques would be used to develop the
                  product. </p>

                            <p>Yes. The maximum word limit for the documentation for the solution is
                  2,000&nbsp;words—see “Word count and format”. Once a student reaches this word limit no

                  example, for explanation, analysis and evaluation), thereby trying to exclude it

                            <p>No. However any material included in the appendix, such as evidence of
                  consultation with the client and/or adviser, should be clearly referenced.
                  Moderators will not be expected to search the appendix for information.</p>

                            <p>No. However, if websites or other source materials are used this should be cited
                  in criterion&nbsp;C as part of the product development. See the section on internal

                            </p>
                            <p>Yes. Any content included in the solution that does not originate from the client
                  or student needs to be cited within it. However, these citations may also appear
                  in criterion&nbsp;C as part of the development of the product. See the section on

                            </p>
                            <p>Yes. If the student fails to use the template in the <em>Record of tasks</em> form

                  does not permit this, then do not sign <em>Form&nbsp;4/ICCSCS</em>, and submit the

                            <p>Yes. Teachers are encouraged to add their comments if possible, either on the
                  actual work or in a separate document. It is of great value to the moderator to
                  see how teachers have arrived at a student’s mark.</p>

                            <p>The internal assessment (IA) marks should be submitted to the IB electronically
                  using the IA/PG marksheet, which can be accessed through consultation with the
                  Diploma Programme coordinator. A selection of sample scripts to be sent to the
                  external moderator will be generated electronically by the IB, and communicated to
                  the teacher by the Diploma Programme coordinator. </p>

                            <p>A summary sheet of the sample sent for external moderation created by IBIS.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What is the IB moderator going to see?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>He or she will see the solution on the required media plus any comments from the
                  teacher on a separate document explaining the awarding of marks.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Should I make a copy of the students’ work?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes. Backup copies are useful as a contingency measure or for future reference.
                  The teacher must submit the original pieces only. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Do I receive any feedback on the internal assessment undertaken by the
                     school?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes. The moderator will write a report on the solution(s) submitted by each
                  school. This will provide comments on the suitability and quality of the work. It
                  will also give recommendations to the school for future solution(s) and address
                  any problems that may have arisen. It is important that teachers follow the
                  recommendations made in previous reports. It is also useful for teachers to read
                  the subject report for computer science. This gives an overview of student
                  performance in this component undertaken by all schools. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Is every student required to sign the front cover on a student’s
                     sheet?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes. Every student must authenticate his or her work by signing the following
                  declaration: “I confirm that this work is my own work and is the final version. I
                  have acknowledged each use of the words or ideas of another person, whether
                  written or oral.” Once the sheet has been signed the declaration cannot be
                  retracted if plagiarism is suspected. If the teacher adds a comment on the sheet
                  that the work may not be authentic, the student will not get a grade. Ultimately,
                  it is the responsibility of the student to ensure the work is authentic.

                            <h3>Using the assessment criteria</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Is there a recommended way to assess the solution?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Yes.</p>
                            <p> The solution should be assessed in the following way: </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li class="liWithoutP">Watch the video of the product functioning (if possible, open the product from
                     the CD-ROM, or access the website).</li>
                                <li class="liWithoutP">Read through all of the documentation to get a “feel” for the work, looking
                     for linkages between criteria.</li>
                                <li class="liWithoutP">Assess each criterion using the level descriptors and best-fit.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What do you mean by best-fit?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>Best-fit requires teachers and moderators to assess the work against all of the
                  information in a level descriptor before awarding a mark that best reflects the
                  work. Please note, this does not mean that the work has to be faultless to award
                  full marks. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What happens if no client and/or adviser is identified?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>The student will self-penalize in criterion A.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What happens if no problem or unanswered question is
                  identified?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>The student will self-penalize in criterion A.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What methods can I use to obtain information from the client and/or
                     adviser in criteria A and&nbsp;E?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>A written record of an interview, either as a summary or transcript, a sound file,
                  a video or an exchange of emails.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What happens if only one product is identified in criterion
                  A?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>This is not a problem. In some cases, such as databases, programming based
                  solutions or wikis, there is only one logical solution. In this case the student
                  must base the justification of this choice of software on its features that make
                  it the only realistic choice. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Why are there more marks for criterion C than for the other
                     criteria?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>The ability of a student to solve a problem is a major part of computer science,
                  therefore this criterion is weighted to reflect this. It also provides moderators
                  with the opportunity to reward students who are “inquiring, open-minded,
                  risk-takers” as well as those who have “played it safe” and completed a relatively
                  basic product well.</p>
                            <p>It is in the nature of this criterion that compromises are made between competing
                  demands within each level descriptor. It is inappropriate to separate these
                  competing demands and ask that the student achieves each maximally to enable the
                  student to obtain full marks. If the separation of the holistic criterion was to
                  occur the competing demands would make it almost impossible to score full marks. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Do we use the past, present or future tense in the record of tasks for
                     criterion B?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>This is not a problem. The schedule submitted is the final edited document. The
                  key requirement is that there is clearly progression. Typically the first two
                  columns (date, action proposed) are completed as part of a plan, the last four
                  columns are completed as the student discusses the solution with the computer
                  science teacher. The completion of the schedule is an ongoing process. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Should the test plan in criterion B include every individual
                     test?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>It is not necessary to show evidence of every individual test that will be carried
                  out in the development of the product, rather, an example of each specific type of
                  test is required. These may include an internal hyperlink, email link, button
                  click, sound clip, calculations in a derived field, loading of a form, printing of
                  a report, correct insertion of text, checking output of a method or class to show
                  evidence it has been considered. </p>
                            <p>The functionality will be tested by the teacher and the moderator. This will
                  ensure that there is consistency between the testing regime in criterion&nbsp;B and the
                  product submitted and will involve the testing of all the different parts of the
                  solution that need to be tested. For example, on a website all the hyperlinks will
                  be tested, in a program different user input may be tested (normal, abnormal and
                  extreme) or in a database a query that specifies a particular criterion to be
                  satisfied will be run and checked against the same query without any criteria. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What happens if no specific performance criteria are stated in criterion&nbsp;A
                     yet specific performance criteria are stated and evaluated in criterion
                     E?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>The student is not penalized in criterion E, but will be penalized in criterion&nbsp;A
                  as they will not have fulfilled the requirement of developing specific performance
                  criteria. </p>

                     being evaluated?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>This is acceptable and demonstrates the development of the product as an organic
                  process.</p>

                            <p>The teacher should alert the student at an early stage that the product is not
                  feasible. Then the student will have to go back to the success criteria and review
                  the designs he or she has submitted.</p>
